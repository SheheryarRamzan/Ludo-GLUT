# Ludo-GLUT
This project is an implementation of a Ludo Star game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and the GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) library. Ludo Star is a popular multiplayer board game, and this project aims to provide a digital version of the game with an interactive and engaging user interface.

Key Features:

Object-Oriented Programming: The project utilizes OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to design and organize the game's structure and functionality, making it modular and easy to maintain.

Interactive User Interface: The game incorporates the GLUT library to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Players can interact with the game using mouse clicks and keyboard inputs to roll the dice and move their pieces on the board.

Multiplayer Support: The game supports 4 player functionality, allowing multiple players to participate simultaneously. Each player takes turns rolling the dice and moving their respective pieces, following the standard rules of Ludo.

Dice Rolling and Piece Movement: The game implements random dice rolling mechanics and enables the movement of player pieces based on the rolled dice values. Players can strategize their moves to progress towards victory while hindering opponents' progress.

Game Rules and Validations: The project enforces the rules of Ludo, ensuring that players can only make valid moves according to the game's regulations. It handles various scenarios, such as capturing opponent's pieces, enabling safe zones, and determining winning conditions.

Score Tracking and Leaderboard: The game keeps track of players' scores and displays them during gameplay. Additionally, it maintains a leaderboard to showcase the performance and rankings of the participating players.
